## Personal
Hello, I'm Alief Prihantoro, a Front-End Web Developer from Indonesia. I specialize in accessibility, performance, and SEO, and I also have a working knowledge of back-end development, UI/UX design, and CI/CD. I'm fluent in Bahasa Indonesia and have a good command of English.

As a developer, I take pride in writing clean, well-organized code that is optimized for performance and cost-effectiveness. I believe that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web development, and I always strive to make my websites as inclusive as possible.

Aside from my work as a developer, I'm also the founder of Muryp, an open-source organization aimed at making web development easier for developers of all skill levels. Through Muryp, I offer tutorials, articles, and open-source projects to help developers improve their skills and build better websites and applications.

Currently, I'm a freelance developer, but I'm also open to project collaborations and hire work in a company. I'm open to working on projects for competitions or even internships in a company to gain more experience and learn from other developers.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and feel free to get in touch if you're interested in working together on a project or just want to connect.
